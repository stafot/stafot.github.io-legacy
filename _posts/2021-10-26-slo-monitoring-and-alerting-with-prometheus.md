## The Challenge of Reliability

As Site Reliability Engineers, we face the constant challenge of balancing system reliability with feature delivery. At Mattermost, we tackled this challenge by implementing a comprehensive Service Level Objective (SLO) Framework.

## Key Components of Our SLO Implementation

### Tools We Used
- **Sloth**: For standardized SLO generation for Prometheus
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification
- **Thanos**: Rule evaluation and long-term storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding

### Implementation Strategy
We started with our most critical application - the Mattermost server, focusing on:
- Availability as our primary SLI
- Error rate monitoring
- Integration with our cloud provisioner
- Automated SLO creation for new workspaces

### Measuring Success
Our initial focus was on availability through error rate monitoring:
```
Error Rate = Error Requests / Total Requests
```

## Future Directions

Our SLO journey continues with plans to:
- Define more service-specific SLIs
- Implement cross-service and cross-cluster SLIs
- Expand the framework to internal services
- Foster a culture of shared responsibility
